i have made a little renderer
i still want to add different kinds of reflections
this is cpu based for shits and giggles (sorry if you are a prospective employer, i won't do it again)
the only dependancies are something to show the rendering (egui) and something to represent and do vector maths (nalgebra)

![demo.png]
this is the current capabilities, there is a light, some coloured objects, and specular reflection. still got loads more to work on
